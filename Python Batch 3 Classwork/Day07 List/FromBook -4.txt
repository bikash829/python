3. IntroduCing  Lists
==================================
what Is a list?
A list is a collection of items in a particular order. 

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)

Accessing Elements in a List
Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by 
telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. 
print(bicycles[0])

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles = [] 
motorcycles.append('honda') 
motorcycles.append('yamaha') 
motorcycles.append('suzuki') 
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
print(motorcycles)

removing an Item Using the del Statement
If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can 
use the del statement. 

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles)
del motorcycles[0] 
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop() 
print(motorcycles)
print(popped_motorcycle)

removing an Item by Value
Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove 
from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you 
can use the remove() method.
For example, let’s say we want to remove the value 'ducati' from the list of 
motorcycles. 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'] 
print(motorcycles)
motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print(motorcycles)

Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort(reverse=True)
print(cars)

Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function
print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))

Printing a List in Reverse Order
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print(cars)
cars.reverse()
print(cars)

Finding the Length of a List
You can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function. The list 
in this example has four items, so its length is 4:
>>> cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
>>> len(cars)

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] 
print(motorcycles[-1])
